Wow, dude, where do I even start? Final Destination: Bloodlines was bananas. I'm still shaking popcorn crumbs out of my hoodie. You know when you can't decide if you need more caffeine or less chaos? That's me right now, on this bench. Feet, heads, flying like paper planes. I swear, there was a moment when a gumdrop (I mean, death) was like the world's sneakiest ninja. Total mind warp! 

The theater was loud, man. My back's all knotted up—must've been the seat, or the sheer tension maybe. When the guy with the broom fell... it was as if my heart decided it would rather CLOCKOUT EARLY. My mind got weird, thinking about how life’s as unpredictable as a game of Jenga played by cats.

> Oh! There was this scene with a CHICKEN—a roasted one—looked so real I could smell it. Maybe I was hallucinating because the lady next to me had KFC smuggled in. It totally merged into the scene where the pool turned into a whirlpool of doom with everyone’s fate like a spinning bottle, pointing aimlessly. 

I remember earlier someone mentioned I should, like, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   first, but geez, man, if my experience was any indication, crash course like this in live horror chaos is a once-in-a-𝘓𝘪𝘧𝘦𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦 sort of deal. How does one even think about re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 something like this when it's already painted on my brain like graffiti?

Do you know how sometimes, you hear a baby randomly burst into laughter during a tense scene? Yeah, that happened, deflating a death sequence like POP. And like, nothing compares to seeing it with surround sound—death whistling like a furious kettle.

Sorry if this disjointed splurge doesn’t make sense. Gotta process my brain, IDE interface talking junk in my head.

Exit theater of doom: FUNC Scheduler(void) { REBOOT; }
